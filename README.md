Directives are a core feature of AngularJS.

Using directives to make standalone UI components.

Why is creating your own directives useful?

1.Readability: Directives let you write expressive HTML. Looking at index.html you can understand the app's behavior just by reading the HTML.

2.Reusability: Directives let you create self-contained units of functionality. We could easily plug in this directive into another AngularJS app and avoid writing a lot of repetitive HTML.
